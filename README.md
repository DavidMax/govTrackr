## About

This is the home of govTrail, an open-source/open-government tool for data journalists and citizens that want to learn about the United States Federal Government. It leverages the [Federal Register API](https://www.federalregister.gov) and several APIs from the [Sunlight Foundation](http://sunlightfoundation.com) to query various parts of the Congressional Record.
